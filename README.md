# Makefiles for social scientists

Short example of using makefiles with R and Stata

## Main files

* `get_data.do`: Downloads sample data from ats.ucla.edu and saves it to a `.dta` file.
* `model.do`: Runs basic regression models on the data
* `figures.R`: Uses `ggplot2` in R to create a few figures
* `Makefile.example`: Fully working Makefile that links all these files together. We'll create this together.
